## ledger-vim

*Feature-free vim plugin for ledger files.*

There already is [vim-ledger](https://github.com/ledger/vim-ledger). However, I
need just very light support for ledger files: syntax colouring, correct
indentation -- `vim-ledger` (tabs) is inconsistent with `ledger` (4 spaces) --
without all the fancy features like folding or ledger interaction.

Hence this new plugin, the aim of which is to be feature-free.
