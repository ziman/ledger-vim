## ledger-vim

*Feature-free vim plugin for ledger files.*

There already is [vim-ledger](https://github.com/ledger/vim-ledger). However, I
just needed a very light support for ledger files: just syntax colouring,
correct indentation (`vim-ledger` (tabs) is inconsistent with `ledger` (4
spaces)), and no fancy features like folding or ledger interaction.  Therefore
I made a new plugin.
